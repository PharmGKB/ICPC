# Data Submission Template

Data submission is handled via file in XLS or XLSX format. Here are the **requirements** and expectations for those files:

1. All data to be processed **must be in a DataSheet named "Subject_level_Data"**
2. Row 1 will be ignored (feel free to put notes here, no required format)
3. Row 2 will contain the column headers
4. Text in the cells of row 2 (column headers) **must exactly match the default template**.
5. Row 3 will contain the column format instructions (no required format)
6. Rows 4+: each row will contain one subject's data
7. **Column A will contain Subject IDs**
8. Columns after column A can be optionally rearranged per submission

There is a [default template](/ICPC_Submission_Template.xlsx) available. That file contains the default column headers that must be used in any data submission.

Any other data sheets added to the submission file will be ignored.
